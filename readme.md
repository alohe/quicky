## Prerequisites

Quicky requires Node.js and npm to be installed on your system. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

## Installation

You can install Quicky globally using npx or npm:

```bash
npx quicky@latest install
```

or

```bash
sudo npm install -g quicky
```

**Note**: Using `sudo` is required to install Quicky globally and to avoid permission issues while configuring domains.

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Quicky

```bash
quicky init
```

Prompts you to enter your GitHub credentials and basic configurations for setting up your projects.

Quicky requires your GitHub access token and username to interact with your repositories. To create a new token, follow these steps:
1. Visit your [GitHub Personal Access Tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and make sure to use **Tokens (classic)**.
2. Click **Generate new token**.
3. Select the required scopes for repository access.
4. Click **Generate token**.
5. Copy the token and provide it to Quicky as your GitHub access token which will be stored locally for future use.

### 2. Deploy a Project

```bash
quicky deploy
```

This command will prompt you to provide:

- Your GitHub username or any organization name
- The repository name
- The port number on which the project should run (e.g., 3000)

**Environment Variables** - During deployment, you'll be asked whether you'd like to add environment variables to your project.

### 3. Manage Projects

```bash
quicky manage
```

Lists all deployed projects and allows you to **start**, **stop**, **restart**, **update**, or **delete** a specific project.

### 4. Configuration Overview

```bash
quicky list
```

Displays an overview of all deployed projects, including the following details:

- **PID**: Project ID.
- **Owner**: GitHub username or organization name.
- **Repository**: Name of the GitHub repository.
- **Port**: Port number on which the project is running.
- **PM2 Status**: Current status of the PM2 process.
- **Last updated**: Date and time of the last deployment/update.

### 5. Domains

Before adding a domain to your project, you need to:

1. Purchase a domain name (e.g., [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), etc.)
2. Purchase a Linux Ubuntu server (e.g., [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), etc.)
3. Create an `A` DNS record pointing to your servers **IPv4** address

```bash
quicky domains
```
Effortlessly **add** and **remove** domains and subdomains for your projects. Seamlessly manages Nginx configurations and automates SSL certificate provisioning, ensuring your applications are always secure and accessible.

### 6. Upgrade Quicky
